Version 0.4  2012-02-20  Jean R. Mavi  <jmavi21@yahoo.com>

* Makefile
    Added commands for cleaning and documentation

* priv/ct_suite_log_parser.peg
    Created Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) for parsing/matching CT's suite.log.html file

* rebar.config
    Removed dependency on mochiweb
    Added dependency erlando, for use of error_m monad
    Added dependency neotoma, for translation of *.peg file into *.erl
    Added pre-compile hook to generate erlang code from PEG file using neotoma

* src/ct_surefire.app.src
    Upgraded version from 0.3 to 0.4
    Added description to ct_surefire library
    Minor formatting improvement

* src/ct_surefire_app.erl
    Removed; there is no need to start/stop this library or any of its dependencies

* src/ct_surefire_sup.erl
    Removed; there are no child processes. Also, this library contains just a convenience module/function, not a running process

* src/ct_surefire.erl
    Created descriptive function generate_surefire_reports/2, retained to_surefire_xml/1,2 as alias functions
    When parsing suite.log.html, replaced ?TAG and follow/2 with neotoma-generated ct_html_log:parse/1 or ct_html_log:file/1
    Used parsing expression grammar file (*.peg) in priv to define pattern for suite.log.html file; also affords greater flexibility if later versions of common_test/test_server change the pattern
    Modified application run directory wildcard from apps.* to *.log; also consolidated three filelib:wildcard/1,2 calls into one
    Added Common Test Surefire XML report suffix _ct, in order to avoid conflict with EUnit Surefire reports
    Tested and verified against common_test-1.6 and test_server-3.5
    Added guards and/or checks against invalid user_data: throws error/exception or returns {error, Reason :: term()}
    Added EDoc comments

* TODO
    Create EUnit test functions
